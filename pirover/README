PiRover is a set of tools to remotely control a tracked vehicle using a 
simple web interface. See http://youtu.be/XaVNxZlOPxU

Web server configuration:
=========================
Change the IP address and port number in CGI scripts in cgi-bin.

Run the webserver on any network connected machine. From this directory, type:

python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000

Substitute 8000 for whatever port you want the webserver to be running.


Raspberry Pi Configurtation:
============================
On the Raspberry Pi, you need the 'poster' package:
     hg clone https://bitbucket.org/chrisatlee/poster poster.tmp
     mv poster.tmp/poster poster
If you don't have "hg", you can manually download it from:
http://atlee.ca/software/poster/dist/0.8.1

Edit the configfile and modify as per your environment. Then run:
sudo rovserver.py configfile

If using inside firewall, you may need to modify firewall to let UDP traffic in. You have to open up UDP port 9999 or, whatever you specified in configfile.

Load up:
http://your.server.address:8000/index.html

The webserver even runs within the RPi.

Click "Forward" and watch your rover move!

TODO:
- Photo/video should be made optional for people who don't have camera module.
- Photo lags behind quite a lot, it needs to load faster.
- Low light camera support.
- Stop refreshing photo if there's no activity.
- Streaming video support.
- Shut down the raspberry pi if battery runs low.
