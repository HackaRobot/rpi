Note: This is work in progress.

PiRover is a set of tools to remotely control a tracked vehicle using a 
simple web interface. See http://youtu.be/XaVNxZlOPxU

Change the IP address and port number in CGI scripts in cgi-bin.

Run the webserver on any network connected machine. From this directory, type:

python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000

Substitute 8000 for whatever port you want the webserver to be running.


On the Raspberry Pi, run:
sudo rovserver.py configfile

See sample configfile for format. If using inside firewall, you may need to modify firewall to let UDP traffic in.

Load up:
http://your.server.address:8000/index.html

The webserver even runs within the RPi.

Click "Forward" and watch your rover move!

Coming soon: POV camera support.
